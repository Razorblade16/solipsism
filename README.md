Solipsism

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sminnee/solipsism.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sminnee/solipsism)

Solipsism is a game-world database for bringing real-time multi-user support to your VR metaverse. It has integrations
with Three.js, Cannon.js, and Ammo.js, but it does not put constraints how you model your world: it is designed so that
you can write bindings between the Solipsism GameWorld and any representation you wish.

For example, you could bind to different representations of voxel objects, a limited number of pre-suppored 3D shapes,
or arbitrary meshes for CSG editing.

How it works
